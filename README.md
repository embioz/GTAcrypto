About
This project is focused on building a Grand Theft Auto 6 role-playing server that integrates cryptocurrency as a central part of the in-game economy. We want to create a server with innovative features that elevate the role-playing experience. Players will be able to interact in ways that are unique to this server, using crypto to engage in business, modify vehicles, and more.
The goal is to build a vibrant online world where players can live out their criminal or legitimate business dreams while also experiencing cutting-edge technology like blockchain and cryptocurrency. If you are passionate about game development, role-playing, and cryptocurrencies, this is the project for you!

Crypto Integration
We are exploring multiple ways to incorporate cryptocurrency into the game, providing players with real-world digital economy interactions. Here are some examples of how crypto will be used:
Crypto Payment for Nightclub Membership: Players can use cryptocurrency to purchase VIP membership to exclusive nightclubs in the game, where they can network with high-profile NPCs like mafia bosses, potential business partners, and more. This will create opportunities for players to expand their criminal or business operations.
Theft Car Shops & Customization: Players can pay in crypto to modify their cars at special Theft Car Shops. These shops will offer custom decals, performance upgrades, and more. Cryptocurrencies will allow for more secure and unique transactions.
Player-Owned Businesses: Players can use crypto to start their own in-game businesses, such as casinos, tech companies, or even underground enterprises. Crypto will be used to purchase assets, pay employees, and invest in the business, creating a real-world feel of managing a business in the criminal underworld.
Digital Assets: Players can own in-game assets that are tied to real-world value. For instance, exclusive cars, clothing, or property could be bought and sold using cryptocurrency, adding another layer of depth to the economy.
These are just a few examples of how cryptocurrency will be embedded into the game. We are still developing the exact mechanics, but the goal is to create a seamless and fun experience where crypto is an integral part of the game.

Role-Playing Features
Our server aims to be the best role-playing experience for GTA 6. Here are some of the features we are working on:
Unique Character Roles: Players can create a wide variety of charactersâ€”ranging from mafia bosses to legitimate entrepreneurs. Each role will come with unique perks, responsibilities, and challenges.
In-Depth Business Systems: Businesses can be established and managed by players, using crypto for investments and payments. These businesses will contribute to the in-game economy and allow for a new dynamic between criminal and legal activities.
Dynamic Economy: A player-driven economy where businesses, services, and products are influenced by player actions and in-game decisions. The cryptocurrency aspect will provide additional layers to this economy, allowing for more freedom in how players earn and spend.
Enhanced Interaction with NPCs: Interact with NPCs who play a role in the story or as potential business partners. Networking and strategic partnerships will be a key part of advancing in the game.
Customizable Vehicles & Property: Beyond the Theft Car Shops, players will have more options to customize and upgrade their cars, homes, and businesses, all tied into the crypto ecosystem.
Immersive Role-Play Environment: We want to create a world where the role-playing experience is deep and engaging. Players can develop their own storylines, alliances, and rivalries, making each interaction meaningful.

Installation
This is a community-driven project, and we are still in the planning and development phases. We will provide an installation guide once the server files are ready for public testing. Stay tuned!
